🔢 Calculator Web App – Project Description<br><br>
📌 Project Title:<br>
Basic Calculator Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
<br><br>
🧠 Objective:<br>
To build a fully functional calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using front-end web technologies.
<br><br>
🛠️ Technologies Used:<br>
HTML5 – for creating the structure of the calculator.
<br>
CSS3 – for designing and styling the layout.
<br>
JavaScript (Vanilla) – for adding interactive functionality and logic.
<br><br>
🧱 Project Features:<br>
Clean and responsive UI.
<br>
Functional buttons for:
<br>
Digits (0–9)
<br>
Operators (+, −, ×, ÷)
<br>
Clear (AC)
<br>
Backspace (optional)
<br>
Equals (=) to calculate the result.
<br>
Real-time display of input and results.
<br>
Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero).
<br>
<br>
📐 Layout Overview:
<br>
A display screen to show input and results.

<br>
A grid of buttons for numbers and operations.

<br>
Optional light/dark mode toggle (for enhancement).

<br>
<br>
⚙️ How It Works:
<br>
User clicks on buttons to input numbers and operations.

<br>
Input is shown in the display area.

<br>
When the equal button is pressed, JavaScript evaluates the expression.

<br>
The result is shown instantly.

<br>
Clear button resets the calculator for a new operation.

<br>
<br>
🧩 Enhancement Ideas (Optional):
<br>
Keyboard support (press keys instead of clicking).

<br>
Advanced functions: square root, percentage, memory (M+, M−), etc.

<br>
Dark mode toggle.

<br>
Animations or transition effects for UI.

<br>
<br>

<br>
Use HTML for page structure.

<br>
Style with CSS for UI design.

<br>
Apply JavaScript to control logic, DOM manipulation, and events.
